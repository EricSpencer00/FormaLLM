The algorithm was introduced by    *)\nNicola Santoro, cf. \"Design and Analysis of Distributed Algorithms\",     *)\nsection 3.8.3, see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_(algorithm). *)\nThe algorithm assumes that nodes are (identified by) integers, and the   *)\nnode with the smallest identity will be elected leader.                  *)\n*)\nThe algorithm orients the edges of the graph. Initially, all edges are   *)\ndirected from smaller to larger node identities, so sources correspond   *)\nto local minima in their neighborhoods and sinks correspond to local     *)\nmaxima. Sources are considered candidates for being leader, and as long  *)\nas their are at least two sources, each round will eliminate at least    *)\none of them.                                                             *)\n*)\nEach round consists of two phases, traditionally called the \"Yo-\" and    *)\n\"-Yo\" phases, that will be called \"down\" and \"up\" phases below.          *)\nThe down phase is initiated by the sources, which broadcast their        *)\nidentity to all neighbors. Non-source nodes wait for values to have been *)\nreceived from all incoming neighbors, then broadcast the minimum value   *)\nthat has been received to all outgoing neighbors. (Sink nodes do not     *)\nsend messages in the down phase.)                                        *)\n*)\nThe up phase is initiated by sink nodes when they have received values   *)\nfrom all neighbors in the down phase. They reply \"yes\" to all neighbors  *)\nthat sent the minimum value and \"no\" to all other neighbors. The other   *)\nnodes wait until messages for the up phase have been received from all   *)\noutgoing neighbors. If one message is \"no\", they send \"no\" to all        *)\nincoming neighbors, otherwise they send \"yes\" to those incoming          *)\nneighbors who sent the smallest value during the down phase and \"no\" to  *)\nall other incoming neighbors. (Source nodes do not send messages in the  *)\nup phase.)                                                               *)\nMoreover, edges along which a \"no\" message is sent during the up phase   *)\nchange orientation. This may change the status of a node (source,        *)\nsink or internal).                                                       *)\n*)\nThe algorithm stabilizes in a state where there is at most one source,   *)\nafter which point only the identity of that source will be sent during   *)\nthe down phase and only \"yes\" messages will be sent during the up phase. *)\nHowever, no node detects termination.

Initially, all edges are   *)\\ndirected from smaller to larger node identities, so sources correspond   *)\\nto local minima in their neighborhoods and sinks correspond to local     *)\\nmaxima. Sources are considered candidates for being leader, and as long  *)\\nas their are at least two sources, each round will eliminate at least    *)\\none of them.                                                             *)\\n*)\\nEach round consists of two phases, traditionally called the \\\"Yo-\\\" and    *)\\n\\\"-Yo\\\" phases, that will be called \\\"down\\\" and \\\"up\\\" phases below.          *)\\nThe down phase is initiated by the sources, which broadcast their        *)\\nidentity to all neighbors. Non-source nodes wait for values to have been *)\\nreceived from all incoming neighbors, then broadcast the minimum value   *)\\nthat has been received to all outgoing neighbors. (Sink nodes do not     *)\\nsend messages in the down phase.)                                        *)\\n*)\\nThe up phase is initiated by sink nodes when they have received values   *)\\nfrom all neighbors in the down phase. They reply \\\"yes\\\" to all neighbors  *)\\nthat sent the minimum value and \\\"no\\\" to all other neighbors. The other   *)\\nnodes wait until messages for the up phase have been received from all   *)\\noutgoing neighbors. If one message is \\\"no\\\", they send \\\"no\\\" to all        *)\\nincoming neighbors, otherwise they send \\\"yes\\\" to those incoming          *)\\nneighbors who sent the smallest value during the down phase and \\\"no\\\" to  *)\\nall other incoming neighbors.

The algorithm was introduced by    *)\\nNicola Santoro, cf. \\\"Design and Analysis of Distributed Algorithms\\\",     *)\\nsection 3.8.3, see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_(algorithm). *)\\nThe algorithm assumes that nodes are (identified by) integers, and the   *)\\nnode with the smallest identity will be elected leader.                  *)\\n*)\\nThe algorithm orients the edges of the graph. Initially, all edges are   *)\\ndirected from smaller to larger node identities, so sources correspond   *)\\nto local minima in their neighborhoods and sinks correspond to local     *)\\nmaxima. Sources are considered candidates for being leader, and as long  *)\\nas their are at least two sources, each round will eliminate at least    *)\\none of them.                                                             *)\\n*)\\nEach round consists of two phases, traditionally called the \\\"Yo-\\\" and    *)\\n\\\"-Yo\\\" phases, that will be called \\\"down\\\" and \\\"up\\\" phases below.          *)\\nThe down phase is initiated by the sources, which broadcast their        *)\\nidentity to all neighbors. Non-source nodes wait for values to have been *)\\nreceived from all incoming neighbors, then broadcast the minimum value   *)\\nthat has been received to all outgoing neighbors. (Sink nodes do not     *)\\nsend messages in the down phase.)                                        *)\\n*)\\nThe up phase is initiated by sink nodes when they have received values   *)\\nfrom all neighbors in the down phase. They reply \\\"yes\\\" to all neighbors  *)\\nthat sent the minimum value and \\\"no\\\" to all other neighbors. The other   *)\\nnodes wait until messages for the up phase have been received from all   *)\\noutgoing neighbors. If one message is \\\"no\\\", they send \\\"no\\\" to all        *)\\nincoming neighbors, otherwise they send \\\"yes\\\" to those incoming          *)\\nneighbors who sent the smallest value during the down phase and \\\"no\\\" to  *)\\nall other incoming neighbors. (Source nodes do not send messages in the  *)\\nup phase.)                                                               *)\\nMoreover, edges along which a \\\"no\\\" message is sent during the up phase   *)\\nchange orientation. This may change the status of a node (source,        *)\\nsink or internal).                                                       *)\\n*)\\nThe algorithm stabilizes in a state where there is at most one source,   *)\\nafter which point only the identity of that source will be sent during   *)\\nthe down phase and only \\\"yes\\\" messages will be sent during the up phase. *)\\nHowever, no node detects termination. Ensuring termination of the        *)\\nalgorithm is achieved by pruning the graph, modeled in a variant of the  *)\\npresent specification.

Initially, all edges are   *)\\ndirected from smaller to larger node identities, so sources correspond   *)\\nto local minima in their neighborhoods and sinks correspond to local     *)\\nmaxima. Sources are considered candidates for being leader, and as long  *)\\nas their are at least two sources, each round will eliminate at least    *)\\none of them.                                                             *)\\n*)\\nEach round consists of two phases, traditionally called the \\\"Yo-\\\" and    *)\\n\\\"-Yo\\\" phases, that will be called \\\"down\\\" and \\\"up\\\" phases below.          *)\\nThe down phase is initiated by the sources, which broadcast their        *)\\nidentity to all neighbors. Non-source nodes wait for values to have been *)\\nreceived from all incoming neighbors, then broadcast the minimum value   *)\\nthat has been received to all outgoing neighbors. (Sink nodes do not     *)\\nsend messages in the down phase.)                                        *)\\n*)\\nThe up phase is initiated by sink nodes when they have received values   *)\\nfrom all neighbors in the down phase. They reply \\\"yes\\\" to all neighbors  *)\\nthat sent the minimum value and \\\"no\\\" to all other neighbors. The other   *)\\nnodes wait until messages for the up phase have been received from all   *)\\noutgoing neighbors. If one message is \\\"no\\\", they send \\\"no\\\" to all        *)\\nincoming neighbors, otherwise they send \\\"yes\\\" to those incoming          *)\\nneighbors who sent the smallest value during the down phase and \\\"no\\\" to  *)\\nall other incoming neighbors. (Source nodes do not send messages in the  *)\\nup phase.)                                                               *)\\nMoreover, edges along which a \\\"no\\\" message is sent during the up phase   *)\\nchange orientation. This may change the status of a node (source,        *)\\nsink or internal).                                                       *)\\n*)\\nThe algorithm stabilizes in a state where there is at most one source,   *)\\nafter which point only the identity of that source will be sent during   *)\\nthe down phase and only \\\"yes\\\" messages will be sent during the up phase. *)\\nHowever, no node detects termination. Ensuring termination of the        *)\\nalgorithm is achieved by pruning the graph, modeled in a variant of the  *)\\npresent specification.
