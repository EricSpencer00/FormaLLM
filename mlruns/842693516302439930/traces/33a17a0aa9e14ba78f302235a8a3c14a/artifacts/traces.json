An atomic register is one in which a read and write acts as   *)\nif it were executed atomically at some time between the beginning and   *)\nend of the operation.  An atomic register can be modeled as one in      *)\nwhich each read and write is a single step in an execution.             *)\n*)\nA regular register is defined there to be one in which a read that      *)\noverlaps some (possibly empty) set of writes to a register obtains a    *)\nvalue that is either the register's value before any of the writes were *)\nbegun or one of the values being written by one of the writes that the  *)\nread overlaps.  (Hence, a read that overlaps no writes obtains the last *)\nvalue written before the read, or the initial value if there were no    *)\nsuch writes before the read.) A regular register r can be modeled in a  *)\nTLA+ spec modeled as a variable rv that equals a set of values.  The    *)\nregister having a value v is modeled by rv equaling {v}.  When a value  *)\nw different from v is written to r, the value of rv first changes to    *)\n{v, w} and then to {w}.  A read of r is modeled as an atomic step that  *)\ncan obtain any value in the set rv.                                     *)\n*)\nThe algorithm of this model is obtained from that of module Simple by   *)\nletting each value x[i] be the set of values representing a regular     *)\nregister.  Since each y[i] is local to process i, we can consider it to *)\nbe atomic.                                                              *)\n*)\nThe problem of generalizing the algorithm of module Simple to use       *)\nregular registers was proposed by Yuri Abraham in                       *)\n*)\nOn Lamport's \"Teaching Concurrency\"                                  *)\nBulletin of EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer     *)\nScience) No. 127, February 2019                                    *)\nhttp://bulletin.eatcs.org/index.php/beatcs/article/view/569          *)\n**************************************************************************)\n--algorithm SimpleRegular {\nvariables x = [i \\in 0..(N-1) |-> {0}], y = [i \\in 0..(N-1) |-> 0] ;\nprocess (proc \\in 0..N-1) {\na1: x[self] := {0,1} ;\na2: x[self] := {1} ;\nb:  with (v \\in x[(self-1) % N]) {y[self] := v }\n}\n}\n****************************************************************************)\nGlobal variables *)\nAllow infinite stuttering to prevent deadlock on termination. *)\n**************************************************************************)\nThe definition of PCorrect is the same as in module Simple.             *)\n**************************************************************************)\n**************************************************************************)\nThe type invariant TypeOK is the obvious modification of the type       *)\ninvariant TypeOK of module Simple.

That   *)\\nalgorithm is an N-process algorithm shared-memory algorithm, in which   *)\\neach process i has a shared register x[i] that it writes and is read by *)\\nprocess x[(i-1) % N].  Each process i also has a local register y[i]    *)\\nthat only it can access.                                                *)\\n*)\\nThe shared registers x[i] in the algorithm of module Simple are assumed *)\\nto be atomic, effectively meaning that each read or write by any        *)\\nprocess is an atomic action.  In the algorithm in this module, the x[i] *)\\nare assumed to be a weaker class of registers called regular registers. *)\\nAtomic and regular registers are defined in the paper                   *)\\n*)\\nOn Interprocess Communication                                        *)\\nDistributed Computing 1, 2 (1986), 77-101                            *)\\n*)\\nwhich can be found on the Web at                                        *)\\n*)\\nhttp://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/interprocess.pdf               *)\\n*)\\nThat paper considers only registers that can be written by a single     *)\\nprocess, but takes into account that reads and writes are not           *)\\ninstantaneous atomic actions, but take a finite length of time and can  *)\\noverlap.  An atomic register is one in which a read and write acts as   *)\\nif it were executed atomically at some time between the beginning and   *)\\nend of the operation.  An atomic register can be modeled as one in      *)\\nwhich each read and write is a single step in an execution.             *)\\n*)\\nA regular register is defined there to be one in which a read that      *)\\noverlaps some (possibly empty) set of writes to a register obtains a    *)\\nvalue that is either the register's value before any of the writes were *)\\nbegun or one of the values being written by one of the writes that the  *)\\nread overlaps.  (Hence, a read that overlaps no writes obtains the last *)\\nvalue written before the read, or the initial value if there were no    *)\\nsuch writes before the read.) A regular register r can be modeled in a  *)\\nTLA+ spec modeled as a variable rv that equals a set of values.  The    *)\\nregister having a value v is modeled by rv equaling {v}.  When a value  *)\\nw different from v is written to r, the value of rv first changes to    *)\\n{v, w} and then to {w}.  A read of r is modeled as an atomic step that  *)\\ncan obtain any value in the set rv.                                     *)\\n*)\\nThe algorithm of this model is obtained from that of module Simple by   *)\\nletting each value x[i] be the set of values representing a regular     *)\\nregister.  Since each y[i] is local to process i, we can consider it to *)\\nbe atomic.                                                              *)\\n*)\\nThe problem of generalizing the algorithm of module Simple to use       *)\\nregular registers was proposed by Yuri Abraham in                       *)\\n*)\\nOn Lamport's \\\"Teaching Concurrency\\\"                                  *)\\nBulletin of EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer     *)\\nScience) No. 127, February 2019                                    *)\\nhttp://bulletin.eatcs.org/index.php/beatcs/article/view/569          *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\n--algorithm SimpleRegular {\\nvariables x = [i \\\\in 0..(N-1) |-> {0}], y = [i \\\\in 0..(N-1) |-> 0] ;\\nprocess (proc \\\\in 0..N-1) {\\na1: x[self] := {0,1} ;\\na2: x[self] := {1} ;\\nb:  with (v \\\\in x[(self-1) % N]) {y[self] := v }\\n}\\n}\\n****************************************************************************)\\nGlobal variables *)\\nAllow infinite stuttering to prevent deadlock on termination. *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\nThe definition of PCorrect is the same as in module Simple.             *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\n**************************************************************************)\\nThe type invariant TypeOK is the obvious modification of the type       *)\\ninvariant TypeOK of module Simple.

That   *)\\nalgorithm is an N-process algorithm shared-memory algorithm, in which   *)\\neach process i has a shared register x[i] that it writes and is read by *)\\nprocess x[(i-1) % N].  Each process i also has a local register y[i]    *)\\nthat only it can access.                                                *)\\n*)\\nThe shared registers x[i] in the algorithm of module Simple are assumed *)\\nto be atomic, effectively meaning that each read or write by any        *)\\nprocess is an atomic action.

An atomic register is one in which a read and write acts as   *)\\nif it were executed atomically at some time between the beginning and   *)\\nend of the operation.  An atomic register can be modeled as one in      *)\\nwhich each read and write is a single step in an execution.             *)\\n*)\\nA regular register is defined there to be one in which a read that      *)\\noverlaps some (possibly empty) set of writes to a register obtains a    *)\\nvalue that is either the register's value before any of the writes were *)\\nbegun or one of the values being written by one of the writes that the  *)\\nread overlaps.  (Hence, a read that overlaps no writes obtains the last *)\\nvalue written before the read, or the initial value if there were no    *)\\nsuch writes before the read.) A regular register r can be modeled in a  *)\\nTLA+ spec modeled as a variable rv that equals a set of values.  The    *)\\nregister having a value v is modeled by rv equaling {v}.  When a value  *)\\nw different from v is written to r, the value of rv first changes to    *)\\n{v, w} and then to {w}.  A read of r is modeled as an atomic step that  *)\\ncan obtain any value in the set rv.                                     *)\\n*)\\nThe algorithm of this model is obtained from that of module Simple by   *)\\nletting each value x[i] be the set of values representing a regular     *)\\nregister.  Since each y[i] is local to process i, we can consider it to *)\\nbe atomic.                                                              *)\\n*)\\nThe problem of generalizing the algorithm of module Simple to use       *)\\nregular registers was proposed by Yuri Abraham in                       *)\\n*)\\nOn Lamport's \\\"Teaching Concurrency\\\"                                  *)\\nBulletin of EATCS (European Association for Theoretical Computer     *)\\nScience) No. 127, February 2019                                    *)\\nhttp://bulletin.eatcs.org/index.php/beatcs/article/view/569          *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\n--algorithm SimpleRegular {\\nvariables x = [i \\\\in 0..(N-1) |-> {0}], y = [i \\\\in 0..(N-1) |-> 0] ;\\nprocess (proc \\\\in 0..N-1) {\\na1: x[self] := {0,1} ;\\na2: x[self] := {1} ;\\nb:  with (v \\\\in x[(self-1) % N]) {y[self] := v }\\n}\\n}\\n****************************************************************************)\\nGlobal variables *)\\nAllow infinite stuttering to prevent deadlock on termination. *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\nThe definition of PCorrect is the same as in module Simple.             *)\\n**************************************************************************)\\n**************************************************************************)\\nThe type invariant TypeOK is the obvious modification of the type       *)\\ninvariant TypeOK of module Simple.

An atomic register is one in which a read and write acts as   *)\\nif it were executed atomically at some time between the beginning and   *)\\nend of the operation.  An atomic register can be modeled as one in      *)\\nwhich each read and write is a single step in an execution.             *)\\n*)\\nA regular register is defined there to be one in which a read that      *)\\noverlaps some (possibly empty) set of writes to a register obtains a    *)\\nvalue that is either the register's value before any of the writes were *)\\nbegun or one of the values being written by one of the writes that the  *)\\nread overlaps.  (Hence, a read that overlaps no writes obtains the last *)\\nvalue written before the read, or the initial value if there were no    *)\\nsuch writes before the read.) A regular register r can be modeled in a  *)\\nTLA+ spec modeled as a variable rv that equals a set of values.  The    *)\\nregister having a value v is modeled by rv equaling {v}.  When a value  *)\\nw different from v is written to r, the value of rv first changes to    *)\\n{v, w} and then to {w}.
