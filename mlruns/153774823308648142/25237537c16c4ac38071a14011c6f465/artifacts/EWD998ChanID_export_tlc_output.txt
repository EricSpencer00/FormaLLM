Exception in thread "main" util.Assert$TLCRuntimeException: TLC writes its files to a directory whose name is generated from the current time.
This directory should be /workspaces/FormaLLM/outputs/generated/states/25-06-24-04-20-25, but that directory already exists.
Trying to run TLC again will probably fix this problem.
