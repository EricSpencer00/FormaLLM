## Replacement Patterns

### Status Indicators
- ✅ / ✓ → [PASS] or [+]
- ❌ / ✗ → [FAIL] or [-] or [ERROR]

### Information Prefixes
- 🤖 (robot) → "Initializing LLM:"
- 📁 (folder) → "Output directory:"
- 📊 (chart) → "MLflow tracking:" or "Saved comparison to:"
- 🦙 (llama) → "Ollama endpoint:"
- 💡 (lightbulb) → "Tip:"
- 🔧 (wrench) → "To reconfigure:"

### Section Headers
All emoji prefixes removed from Markdown headers while maintaining hierarchy and content.

## Verification

Run the following command to verify no emojis remain:
```bash
grep -rn '[🀀-🫿]' . --include="*.py" --include="*.md" --include="*.sh"
```

Expected output: No matches (clean)

## Academic Standards

The codebase now adheres to professional academic standards:
- Clear, descriptive text instead of visual symbols
- Professional appearance in all documentation
- Terminal output uses standard ASCII markers
- All technical content preserved without loss of information
