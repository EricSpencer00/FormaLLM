IDs are unique
successor along the ring
initiators send their own ID to their neighbor
handle some incoming message
nodes that have already lost forward the message
received smalled ID: record loss and forward the message
do not forward the message; if it's the own ID, declare win
end with
end while

- N is the number of nodes                                              *)
- Id is a sequence of natural numbers of length N such that             *)
Id[i] denotes the identity of node i.                                 *)
The algorithm can be initiated by several nodes, and the node with    *)
the smallest identity will be elected as the leader.                  *)
