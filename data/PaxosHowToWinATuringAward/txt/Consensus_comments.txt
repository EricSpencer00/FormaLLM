(* value is chosen by describing the set of all chosen values.  The naive  *)
(* requirement is that this set never contains more than one value, which  *)
(* is an invariance property.  But a little thought shows that this        *)
(* requirement allows a value to be chosen then unchosen, and then another *)
(* value to be chosen.  So we specify that the set of chosen values is     *)
(* initially empty, it can be set to a single value, and then it can never *)
