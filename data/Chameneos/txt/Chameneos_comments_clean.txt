N - number of total meeting after which chameneoses fade
M - number of chameneoses
For each chameneoses, remember its current color and how many meetings it has been in.
A meetingPlace (called Mall in the original paper) keeps track of the chameneoses
creature that is currently waiting to meet another creature.
chameneos enters empty meeting place
chameneos takes on faded color
meeting place is not empty - two chameneoses mutate
Repeatedly try to enter meeting place for chameneoses that are not faded yet.
The system terminates once the color of all chameneoses is faded.
Upon termination, the sum of the (individual) meetings that all creates have
been in, is equal to 2*N.  It is *not* guaranteed that all chameneoses have
been in a meeting with another chameneoses.  See section A. Game termination
on page 5 of the original papaer).
