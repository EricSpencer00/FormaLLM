Erroneous Non blocking Atomic Committment Protocol (ACP-NB)
The mistake is to deliver a broacast message locally *before* it has been
forwarded to other participants.
This protocol does not satisfy the consistency property AC1
Participants type is extended with a "forward" variable.
Coordinator type is unchanged.
Initially, participants have not forwarded anything yet
Participant statements that realize a better broadcast
forward(i,j): forwarding of the predecision from participant i to participant j
IF
particpant i is alive
participant i has received a decision and has decided (it shouldn't have decided yet)
participant i has not yet forwarded this decision to participant j
THEN
participant i forwards the decision to participant j
decideOnForward(i,j): participant i receives decision from participant j
IF
participant i is alive
participant i has yet to receive a decision
participant j has forwarded its decision to participant i
THEN
participant i decides in accordance with participant j's decision (it should only predecide)
abortOnTimeout(i): conditions for a timeout are simulated
IF
participant is alive and undecided and coordinator is not alive
coordinator died before sending decision to all participants who are alive
all dead participants died before forwarding decision to a participant who is alive
THEN
decide abort
