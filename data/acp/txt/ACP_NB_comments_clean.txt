Non blocking Atomic Committment Protocol (ACP-NB)
The non blocking property AC5 is obtained by using a reliable broadcast
implemented as follows:
- upon reception of a broadcast message, this message is forwarded to all
participants before it's delivered to the local site;
- since participant i does not forward to itself, forward[i] is used to
store the decision before it's delivered (and becomes "decision")
Participants type is extended with a "forward" variable.
Coordinator type is unchanged.
Initially, participants have not forwarded anything yet
Participant statements that realize a better broadcast
forward(i,j): forwarding of the predecision from participant i to participant j
IF
particpant i is alive
participant i has received a decision (stored in forward[i])
participant i has not yet forwarded this decision to participant j
THEN
participant i forwards the decision to participant j
preDecideOnForward(i,j): participant i receives decision from participant j
IF
participant i is alive
participant i has yet to receive a decision
participant j has forwarded its decision to participant i
THEN
participant i (pre)decides in accordance with participant j's decision
preDecide(i): participant i receives decision from coordinator
IF
participant i is alive
participant i has yet to receive a decision
coordinator has sent its decision to participant i
THEN
participant i (pre)decides in accordance with coordinator's decision
decideNB(i): Actual decision, after predecision has been forwarded
IF
participant i is alive
participant i has forwarded its (pre)decision to all other participants
THEN
participant i decides in accordance with it's predecision
abortOnTimeout(i): conditions for a timeout are simulated
IF
participant is alive and undecided and coordinator is not alive
coordinator died before sending decision to all participants who are alive
all dead participants died before forwarding decision to a participant who is alive
THEN
decide abort
