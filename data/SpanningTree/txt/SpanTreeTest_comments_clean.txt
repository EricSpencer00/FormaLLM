**************************************************************************)
The specification in this module is a modified version of the one in    *)
module SpanTree obtained by replacing the declared constant Edges with  *)
a variable of the same name that is set initially to any possible set   *)
of edges with nodes in Nodes.  Thus, it can be used to test the         *)
algorithm of SpanTree on all possible graphs having a particular number *)
of nodes.                                                               *)
**************************************************************************)
***************************************************************)
SUBSET S is the set of all subsets of a set S.  Thus, this   *)
allows Edges to have as its initial value any set of sets of *)
nodes containing exactly two nodes.                          *)
***************************************************************)
**************************************************************************)
This took a few seconds to check for 4 nodes, and about 25 minutes for  *)
5 nodes on my laptop.  To compute the initial value of Edges, TLC has   *)
to compute all the elements of SUBSET (SUBSET Nodes) (the set of all    *)
subsets of the set of all sets of nodes) and then throw away all the    *)
elements of that set that don't consist entirely of sets having         *)
cardinality 2.  For N nodes, SUBSET(SUBSET Nodes) contains 2^(2^N)      *)
elements.                                                               *)
