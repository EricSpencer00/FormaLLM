Init  except that  active  and  color  are restricted to TRUE and "white" to
not waste time generating initial states nobody needs.

Reduce the number of initial states.

TODO to also update TLC's depth parameter.
A trace ending with  terminationDetected = TRUE  that is longer than 22

Temporal logics got rid of explicit state indices.  However, when we transform
counter-examples, the annoyances of handling indices re-surface.  Especially,
we are dealing with *finite* prefixes of behaviors.
The  n \in Node  whose "variables" changed in the current step compared to
the *predecessor* state.  The parameter  s  represents the current state,
the parameter  t  the predecessor state.
Determining whether or not a node has changed is usually easiest by
introducing a prophecy variable into the spec (see  thread  variable in
https://git.io/JZ0Wb).
This should be a model value:  CHOOSE n : n \notin Node
