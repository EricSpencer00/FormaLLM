\* No support for RECURSIVE in PlusPy.
\* SimpleCycle is a recursive variant of the predicate IsSimpleCycle above. It
\* does not work with PlusPy, but is orders of magnitude faster when evaluated
\* by TLC.
(* View r as a graph s.t. S is the graph's set of vertices and there 
     exists an edge from s to t iff f[s] = t. IsFiniteSet(DOMAIN r). *)
