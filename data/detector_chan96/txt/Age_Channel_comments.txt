(* All messages sent by correct processes. *)
(* Every message is put into a box which has information
                          about how long this message have been in transit. *)
(* All messages are in transit. *)
(* inDelivery contains messages which are delivered
                          to a process p_i in this transition. *)
(* Pack a message into a box with its age which shows how long a message
    have been in transit. *)
(*  - Unpack boxes to get messages. Ages is not delivered. 
    - Those messages are delivered to a process in this transition. *)
(* Initialization *)
(* No boxes are in transit. *)
(* No messages are delivered. *)
(* Pack a set msgs of messages with ages and put them in transit *)
(*  - Non-deterministically choose some boxes and deliver associated messages to rcver. 
    - Messages which are delivered are removed from inTransit. *)
(*  - Every message in transit attains a new age at every tick of the environmental clock. 
    - Recall that we don't directly specify the environmental clock  in this encoding way.
      At every tick of the global clock, we only increase ages of boxes in transit.  
    - We can keep inDelivery unchanged. However, I set inDelivery' an empty set because it 
      makes an execution path more (human) readable, at least for me.  *)
(* Type invariant for inTransit and inDelivery. *)
