(* An encoding of a parameterized model of the reliable broadcast by message diffusion [1] 
   with crashed failures in TLA+. This broadcast algorithm is described in Fig. 4 of [1].

   distributed systems." Journal of the ACM (JACM) 43.2 (1996): 225-267.
  
   A short description of the parameterized model is described in:

(* If a correct process received an INIT message or was initialized with V1, 
   it accepts this message and then broadcasts ECHO to all.

(* If a correct process received an ECHO messageaccepts, it accepts and then 
   broadcasts ECHO to all.  *)
(* If a number of crashed processes is less than F, some correct process may crash. *)
(* A process can receive messages, broadcast ECHO to all, accept or become a crashed one *)
(* the transition step *)
(* Add the weak fairness condition since we want to check the liveness condition. *)
(* V0 - a process did not received an INIT message 
   V1 - a process received an INIT message 
   AC - a process accepted and sent the message to everybody  
   CR - a process is crashed

(* If no correct process does not broadcast then no correct processes accepts. *)
(* Unforg is correct iff the initial state is InitNoBcast. *)
(* If a correct process broadcasts, then every correct process eventually accepts. *)
(* If a correct process accepts, then every correct process eventually accepts.  *)
(* If a message is sent by a correct process, then every correct processes eventually
   receives this message. *)
