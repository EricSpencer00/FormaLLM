\* LongestCommonPrefix in View for a single server would always shorten the
\* log to <<>>, reducing the state-space to a single state.
\* Combining the following conditions makes the state space finite:
\* 1) The divergence of any two logs is bounded (See Extend action)
\*
\* 2) Terms is a *finite* set.
\*
\* 3) The longest common prefix of all logs is discarded.
