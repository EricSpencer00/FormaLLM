First prove when <<Gossip(n,o)>>_vars is enabled.
We need a copy of the above theorem where all variables are primed.
One could derive this from MeasureType using PTL, but we just copy
and paste the proof.
The termination measure is zero iff all nodes agree on the
counter values of all nodes.
A Gossip action will never increase the measure.
A non-stuttering Gossip action decreases the measure.
The following is the main liveness theorem. Its proof is quite tedious
because of a delicate interplay of predicate and temporal logic reasoning.
must explicitly "box" the following assumption,
otherwise PTL reasoning fails below.
The following step just commutes [] and \A in the assumption of <1>1
so that we can apply the induction theorem in the following step.
Now turn the outermost universal quantifier into an existential quantifier
on the left-hand side of the consequent.
Clearly P(m) must hold for some natural number initially.
The final theorem is a simple corollary.
Tedious proof of an "obvious" fact, due to interplay of first-order
and temporal reasoning. Could this be proved automatically?
