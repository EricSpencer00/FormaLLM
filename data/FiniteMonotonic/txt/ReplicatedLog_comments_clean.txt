Why does WriteTx also increment executed?
It increments executed[n] for one of the nodes n.
ExecuteTx catches up the other nodes.
With a single node, ExecuteTx is a no-op because
t is never enabled.
The following conjunct causes the spec to not be machine
closed. This is orthogonal to the Finite Monotonic
approach.

ExecFairSpec and WriteFairSpec both work because every suffix with
infinitely many WriteTx implies Convergence to WriteTx's enablement
condition.  Likewise, every suffix with infinitely many ExecuteTx
implies Convergence.
