The leader is one of the processes.
The sum of the weights of all processes and the messages in transit is always 1.
All processes except the leader are idle.
No weights have been "thrown" yet.
No messages have been sent yet.
This spec models a fully meshed network.
The order in which messages are received does not matter.
This enablement condition prevents an idle process to send a zero weight message.
An idle process throws its weight back to leader.
The order in which messages are received does not matter.
Prevent the weights from halving towards infinity.
Pretty printing of error-trace states.
