One node starts in the SYN-SENT state, i.e., one node has already received the active open command. The other node
is in the listen state, i.e., it has received the passive open command.
A real system will allow infinitely many active opens of TCP connections. An
explicit state model checker like TLC cannot enumerate infinitely many states.
Thus, do not allow multiple active opens (the first active open is implicit in Init).
