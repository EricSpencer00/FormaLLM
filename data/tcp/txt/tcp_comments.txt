\* TODO: ACK of SYN
\* TODO: Timeout=2MSL
\* The local FIN is also acknowledged, i.e., skipping the CLOSING state.
\* ??? The RFC doesn't explictly mention this, but we send the ACKofFIN here.
\* ??? "...can be sent from any state with a corresponding transition to TIME-WAIT"
\* ??? could also be interpreted as those states from where we can tranisiton to TIME-WAIT,
\* ??? i.e., FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSING.
\* ??? RFC 9293 doesn't mention this, but it seems impossible to send a RST without a TCB.
\* Would get stuck in SYN-SENT if we don't assert a user command.
\* If there are no messages in flight and one node is in the ESTABLISHED
\* state, then the other node is also in the ESTABLISHED state. When
\* message are in flight, the state of the nodes can be different.

This spec abstracts from many details such as sequence numbers in RFC9293 and
focuses on the state transitions of the TCP finite state machine shown in the
diagram at the end of this file.
*)
(* Note 2: A transition from FIN-WAIT-1 to TIME-WAIT if a FIN is received
       and the local FIN is also acknowledged. *)
(* Note 3: A RST can be sent from any state with a corresponding transition 
       to TIME-WAIT (see [70] for rationale). Similarly, receipt of a RST from
       any state results in a transition to LISTEN or CLOSED. *)
