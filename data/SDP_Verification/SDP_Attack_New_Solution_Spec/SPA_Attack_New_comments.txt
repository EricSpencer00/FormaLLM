\* Temporal Property 2: SPA_AntiDosProperty
\* This formula asserts the Anti-Dos property of SDP controller,which means the controller
\* can always inspect and defeat spoof and replay attack.
\* The following formula asserts that every SPA replay attack inspected by the SDP controller is originated from the attacker
\* The following formula asserts that every SPA spoof attack inspected by the SDP controller is originated from the attacker
\* The following formula asserts that the system's behavior eventually always meets the underlying propositions
\* IF attacker ever captured legistimate SPA packets by sniffing,then:
\* 1. For every captured legistimate SPA messages, the attacker will launch a SPA attack according to the message info.
\* 2. Every SPA attack message launched by the attacker will be inspected and blocked by the SDP controller.
\*
\* IF attacker never captured legistimate SPA packets, then no SPA attack is lanched.
\* Temporal Property 3: UserAccessAvailProperty
\* This formula asserts the availability of the data plane service ,which means
\* legistimate user can finally access the target server except the case that 3 tuple Acl Rule is aged before th TCP connection established.
\* scenario1: TCP link established, and exactly matched Acl Rule available in FW.
\* Temporal Property 4: SvrHidenProperty
\* This formula asserts the service hidden property of the SDP arhitecture. which means
\*  finally attacker can not establish any link with the target server.

\* Temporal Property 5: FwRuleConsistentProperty
\* This formula asserts that for each successful auth session in history there exists
\*  a corresponding 3 Tuple Acl Rule on FW, available or aged, vice versa.
\* the consistent between user's SPA session and ever configured L3 tuple Acl Rule on Fire Wall
\* Temporal Property 6: FwCorrectProperty
\* This formula asserts that the Fire Wall's Packets filitering function works well, which means
\* that for any unestablished TCP links there must exists packets dropping by FireWall.
\*to simplify the model, we don't consider TCP packets re-transport mechanism for attacker,
\* so attacker established TCP links without packet dropping.
\* But for a legistimate user, its first TCP SYN packets might be routed to the FW before the corresponding ACL Rule is configured,
\* so commonly, this TCP link should be established by the retransmit of SYN packet after the rule is configured.
