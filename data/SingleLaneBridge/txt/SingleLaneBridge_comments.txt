\* A bridge over a river is only wide enough to permit a single lane of traffic.
\* Consequently, cars can only move concurrently if they are moving in the same
\* direction. A safety violation occurs if two cars moving in different directions
\* enter the bridge at the same time.
\* To visualize the problem, refer to https://flylib.com/books/en/2.752.1.48/1/
\* Actions
\* Two cars or more cannot be in the same location in the Bridge at the same time
\* The bridge capacity should be respected
\* Two cars of different directions can never be in the bridge
\* All cars eventually exit the Bridge
\* All cars eventually enter the bridge
