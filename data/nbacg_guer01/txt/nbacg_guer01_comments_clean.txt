An encoding of a parameterized model of the asynchronous non-blocking atomic commitment
algorithm with failure detectors in TLA+. The algorithm is described in the following paper:

Some process will crash in the next state. If the process has not proposed its initial
value, the upper bound of the number of messages with the same value will be increased.
A process starts receiving messages after sending its vote. If a process crashed or decides,
it stops receiving messages.

A correct process sends YES messages to all processes. *)
A correct process sends NO messages to all processes. *)
A suspicious process aborts. *)
A correct process aborts after it received a NO message *)
A correct process commits since it knows that all processes propose YES *)
Avoid deadlocks.
After deciding, a correct process does nothing. *)
In this specification, a process can vote YES or NO. Weak fairness condition is added
since we want to check liveness properties.
All processes vote YES. *)
All processes vote NO. *)
Type invariant *)
No two correct processes decide differently. *)
If some process votes NO, no process commits. *)
If every processes votes YES and no process is suspected, then no process crashes or aborts. *)
If no process crashes or is suspicious, then every process eventually commits. *)
