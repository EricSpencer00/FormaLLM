\* A tiny graph with three nodes.
\* We don't care which node gets
\* picked as the initiator.
\* The tiny graph is fully meshed:
\*      <<"a", "a">> :> FALSE @@
\*      <<"a", "b">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"b", "a">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"b", "b">> :> FALSE @@
\*      <<"a", "c">> :> TRUE @@
\*      <<"c", "a">> :> TRUE @@
\*      <<"b", "c">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"c", "b">> :> TRUE  @@
\*      <<"c", "c">> :> FALSE
\* More concisely defined as:
\* To get a graph that satisfies the
\* assumptions in Echo, we simply
\* define R to be:
\* Print R to stdout at startup.
