\* In order to show messages, we need a (auxiliary) history variable to remember
\* the occurrence of a SendMsg step including the sender and receiver of a message.
\* The spec below is equivalent to EWD840 except for the history variable, and
\* AnimInit more constraint to reduce the number of initial states.
\* The token is initially always at N - 1.
\* 12pts (x/y) offset to be concentric with RingNetwork.
\* Labels
\* Ring Network
\* round (rx=15) if node is active.
\* Token ring (with larger radius than ring above and only for the node that currently holds the token).
\* Group always expects a sequence!
\* Messages send from one node to another.  A proper arrow would be more intuitive with regards to the direction
\* of message flow but SVG doesn't natively has arrows.  This is why we use a lollipop instead where the ball
\* replaces the arrowhead.
\* Centers the line/circle at the center of a node instead of
\* a node's left upper corner (which are its 0:0 coordinates).
\* This is just the arrow head that's used by the Message definition above as an attribute.

\* Property that leads to interesting traces when animated.
