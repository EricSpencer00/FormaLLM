\* Trace operator &
\* JsonSerialize operator (both in CommunityModules-deps.jar)
\* The ordinary invariant to check in EWD840 module.
\* Stop model-checking *without* TLC reporting
\* the usual text-based error trace. Replace
\* with FALSE to also print the error-trace
\* and terminate with non-zero process exit
\* value.

  The trick is that TLC evaluates disjunct 'Export' iff 'RealInv' equals FALSE.
  JsonInv is the invariant that we have TLC check, i.e. appears in the config.

  Comment e.g. the "active[i]" conjunct in EWD840!SendMsg to trigger a violation
  of `RealInv`.
