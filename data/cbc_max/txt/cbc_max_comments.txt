(* An encoding of the conditional consensus protocol based on the maximal value  
   which is proposed by processes. This protocol is described in Fig. 1 with 
   condition C1 in [1].

(* If there are less than F faulty processes, process i becomes faulty. *)
(* Receives a new message *)
(* Broadcasts PHASE1(v_i, i) *)
(* If a process received PHASE1(_, _) from at least N - F processes, it is ready
   to update its view and to make an estimation.
 *)
(* A process broadcasts its estimated value. *)
(* If a process receives a new PHASE2, it updates its local view. If the expected 
   value w in the message is also one from the majority, it decides w. If the input 
   vector does not belong to the condition and no process crashes, V_i eventually 
   becomes the "full" input vector and process i deterministically decide. If all 
   PHASE2 messages has received, process i moves to step Choose.
 *)
(* Process i has received all PHASE2 messages and therefore, it can deterministically
   choose a value appearing in V[i]. 
 *)
(* If a process decides v, then v was proposed by some process. *)
(* No two processes decide differently. *)
(* Every correct process eventually decides on some values. *)
(* At least F + 1 processes initialize with the greatest value MAX(v). *)
(* If the input vector satisfies the Condition1, the algorithm terminates. *)
